This is my open source book :P
    **HOWDY** wellcome to the goof land - an opes source DIY-able fenzine 
* *the narrator encouragengly keeps yapping about some art chaos autobiography he was eagarly fantasicing to make* *
* and it felt like his yapping could last forever ... as the time past, it became harder and harder to concentrain on the same train of though
* he decided to paraphrase the unfinished subject matter, and make sure to add this on the back of the potential book in production 
(possibly also hide in random dezines and other artwork witch will be also hosted in this book and thus can and will be printed (BOGOS BINTED :*0_0*)

 so anyway, for the amount of pages, the goal is probably at least more than there is frames in known in the local comunities animated clip for the song bad apple [insert the qr code somewhere here]
